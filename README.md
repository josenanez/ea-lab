*by [JoseNanez.com](https://www.josenanez.com) — Strategy, Ethics & Intelligent Execution*

**EA-LAB** is the enterprise architecture lab of [JoseNanez.com](https://www.josenanez.com), a strategic consulting firm that helps organizations design modern, interoperable, and business-aligned technology ecosystems.

> This repository is part of our [Enterprise Architecture](https://www.josenanez.com/verticales/core) vertical — where we build capability maps, reference models, and strategic assets to bridge the gap between vision and execution.

## 🎯 Purpose · From Vision to Execution

EA-LAB exists to support enterprise leaders, architects, and transformation teams in turning strategic intent into coherent, modern, and scalable technology architectures.

We design this lab to serve as a strategic toolkit to:

- Model business capabilities and their supporting systems
- Define layered reference architectures for digital ecosystems
- Guide modernization efforts with actionable roadmaps
- Align architecture with frameworks like BIAN, TRL, IRL, CRL and MACH
- Enable governance through metrics, visuals, and decision tools

> Our goal is to bridge the gap between business strategy and enterprise architecture—creating assets that drive transformation with clarity and confidence.

## 🧪 Tools & Methodologies

EA-LAB is a modular and vendor-neutral knowledge base. It provides strategic architecture assets built using practical tools and globally recognized frameworks.

### 📐 Architecture & Design Tools

- **Draw.io** – Visual modeling and stakeholder alignment
- **Google Workspace / Keynote** – Executive-ready architecture presentations
- **Archi / ArchiMate** – Enterprise architecture notation and toolsets
- **Markdown + Mermaid.js** – Lightweight diagrams and documentation

### 📚 Frameworks & Methodologies

- **BIAN** – Component-based reference model for the banking and financial services industry; supports service-based architecture and interoperability.
- **HL7 (Health Level Seven)** – Set of international standards for the exchange, integration, sharing, and retrieval of electronic health information; critical for healthcare systems interoperability.
- **Ed-Fi (Education Framework for Interoperability)** – Open standards and data models designed to enable real-time, actionable insights in educational systems.
- **GS1 (Global Standards One)** – Global supply chain standard for product identification, data sharing, and traceability, widely used in retail, healthcare, and logistics.
- **TRL (Technology Readiness Level)** – Framework for evaluating the maturity of a given technology, from ideation to full deployment.
- **CRL (Commercial Readiness Level)** – Framework for assessing a solution’s market viability and organizational readiness to scale.
- **MRL (Manufacturing Readiness Level)** – Framework to evaluate readiness of manufacturing processes, technologies, and integration into supply chains.
- **MACH Alliance** – Modern architectural principles: Microservices, API-first, Cloud-native, Headless. Promotes composable, agile digital ecosystems.
- **ISO/IEC 42010** – International standard for architecture descriptions of systems and software engineering.


### ☁️ Infrastructure Considerations

- **Cloud-agnostic designs** – Assets apply to AWS, Azure, GCP or hybrid environments
- **API-first orientation** – Compatible with modern platforms and digital ecosystems
- **Integration-friendly** – Designed for use alongside CI/CD and DevOps practices

> This lab prioritizes clarity, modularity, and strategic alignment over implementation code.
